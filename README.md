# DeprecationsUnite

The aim of this tool is to simply make it easier to merge many deprecation lists into one.

**NOTE:** I wrote this to work specifically with [next_rails](https://github.com/fastruby/next_rails) deprecation lists. This is not a generic tool, although
I do think this will be able to merge any json files you pass to it, but that is unintended behavior.

## Requirements

You need to have Elixir 1.13 installed.

## Installation

This is a CLI program and is available in hex.pm. All you need to run is:

```bash
mix archive.install hex deprecations_unite
```
